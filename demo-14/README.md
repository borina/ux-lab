# webpack sample project 
 
Sample webpack project with ES6 and Sass.

This is a very basic setup that only includes two main app files for demo purposes: `./src/main.js` and `./src/main.scss`.

## Environment setup 

```sh
  $ npm install
```

## Development

Start the Webpack server (includes live reloading when you change files):

```sh
  $ npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in a browser.
